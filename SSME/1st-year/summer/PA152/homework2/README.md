# Home Assignment No. 2

### Result
```txt
Task 1: you assume that grade IS NULL means that the enrollment is for the
current semester; this is likely true but it was not said in the task
definition, next time work only with the information you are explicitly given
Task 2: ok
Task 3: ok
Task 4: ok
Task 5: in T(G) you use formula that is intended for non-exclusive OR, i.e. OR
where more than one of the conditions can be true at the same time (e.g. in
"name='Jan' OR surname='Novak'"); in your query this cannot happen so
T(G)=T(G2.A)+T(G2.FA)+T(G2.FFA);
V(C,studentId) does not exist, there are two attributes
student_registered_to_PA152.studentId and student_with_A_from_PB154.studentId
in the result of C, their variabilities are 450 and 223, respectively; you need
to divide by max of these;
-0.5p
-----------
Sum: *4.5
